      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD Candidate with the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics in Monash Univerisity. I&amp;rsquo;m working with Catherine Forbes and Anastasios Panagiotelis to develop fast algorithms to update forecasts as more data is observed. For more details, see my research page.
I&amp;rsquo;m also teaching Statistical Methods for Insurance, and Financial Econometrics at Monash, and I&amp;rsquo;ll add more details for these subjects throughout the next two semesters as the classes progress.</description>

      <description>What is this all about? Imagine playing a game where your opponent has a rigged dice, before the game starts you probably think that every side is equally likely to be rolled, but after they roll several sixes in a row you might begin to think that somethingâ€™s wrong. Bayesian statistics is a tool that lets us express a change in belief as more data (or dice rolls) are observed using probability, the mathematical language of uncertainty.</description>
