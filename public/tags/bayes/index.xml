      <description>What is this all about? Imagine playing a game where your opponent has a rigged dice, before the game starts you probably think that every side is equally likely to be rolled, but after they roll several sixes in a row you might begin to think that somethingâ€™s wrong. Bayesian statistics is a tool that lets us express a change in belief as more data (or dice rolls) are observed using probability, the mathematical language of uncertainty.</description>
